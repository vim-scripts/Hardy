vim-hardy provides support for Arduino in vim.  It covers syntax, compilation,
and verification for Arduino code.  I decided to call this plugin "vim-hardy"
because "Arduino" means "hardy friend" in italian. Note that I did not
write the arduino syntax file, it was created by Johannes Hoff, and is available here:
vimscript#2654

Arduino IDE version 1.5.0 and up is required for the compilation and uploading
of Arduino code.  By default, vim-hardy looks for it in your PATH, but you can
specify an installation directory with "g:hardy_arduino_path`"

To verify an Arduino file, run ":ArduinoVerify".  To compile and upload it, use
":ArduinoUpload".  For information on any options and other features, see
"doc/hardy.txt".

For development versions and bug reports, see the Github repository:
